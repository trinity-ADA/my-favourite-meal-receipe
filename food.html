        <h2>Yam Porridge</h2>
        <p>
          My favourite meal is called Yam Porridge. The origin of this dish can
          be dated as far back as the native kitchens of our African mothers.
          Yam was a stable food in the early days, pretty much anything
          carbohydrate was common. However, yam was mostly eaten with fresh palm
          oil in separate plates but as the <i>art of cooking</i> evolved, yam
          became more delicious when boiled with fresh palm oil, fresh fish,
          onions, and other ingredients below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me now take you on a journey into the preparation of my favourite
          yam porridge.

      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Peel the skin off your yam.</li>
        <li>Cut it into small chunks and put in the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Add water to cover the yam surface, and place over the fire.</li>
        <li>Wash and clean out the fresh fish, smoked fsh snd dry fish.</li>
        <li>
          Soak the dry fish in hot water, while you boil the fresh fish
          separately.
        </li>
        <li>
          After about 15 minutes, add your spices, smoked fish, ground pepper,
          crayfish, sliced onions, and palm oil to the yam.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leave to cook for 10 more minutes, check for softness of your yam and
          stir.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not allow the water to <strong>dry</strong> up in the yam. This
          makes the porridge.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot</li>
